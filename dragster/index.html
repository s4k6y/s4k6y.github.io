        Our fourth and final project was a carbon-dioxide-powered dragster. Unfortunately, it was the end of the year and
        we did not have time to actually make it in class, so I just created the design in SketchUp. We would've put a can
        or bottle of CO2 in the back and raced our dragsters if we'd had time; I think that would've been one of the most
        fun activities in tech class!
